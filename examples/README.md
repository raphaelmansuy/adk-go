# ADK GO samples

This folder hosts examples to test different features. The examples are usually minimal and simplistic to test one or a few scenarios.

**Note**: This is different from the [google/adk-samples](https://github.com/google/adk-samples) repo, which hosts more complex e2e samples for customers to use or modify directly.

## Example Highlights

### Session History Compaction
New feature that reduces token usage in long-running conversations by 60-80%!

See [`examples/compaction/`](./compaction/) for:
- **Basic Example** (`main.go`): Quick start with all launcher modes
- **Advanced Example** (`advanced/main.go`): Direct runner usage with interactive conversation
- Complete configuration guide and troubleshooting tips


# Launcher
In many examples you can see such lines:
```go
l := full.NewLaucher()
err = l.ParseAndRun(ctx, config, os.Args[1:], universal.ErrorOnUnparsedArgs)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("run failed: %v\n\n%s", err, l.FormatSyntax())
}
```

it allows to to decide, which launching options are supported in the run-time. 
`full.NewLauncher()` includes all major ways you can run the example:
* console
* restapi
* a2a
* webui (it can run standalone or with restapi or a2a).

Run `go run ./example/quickstart/main.go help` for details

As an alternative, you may want to use `prod.NewLaucher()` which only builds-in restapi and a2a launchers.
